  <h3>- I AM PIOLO VON REYES.</h3>
  <p class="subheader">A STUDENT OF ASIA PACIFIC COLLEGE</p>
  <p class="desc">A 23 year old 'Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, specializing in Mobile and Internet technologies' student. This personal webpage is part of my front-end learning journey as a BSIT student. I am a transferee student from Colegio de San Juan de Letran as a former 'Bachelor of Science, in Electronics and Communications Engineering' student. Finding my passion in software development more than hardware learning, I took my opportunity to enroll and shift to this course at Asia Pacific College.</p>

  <h2>OTHER INFO ABOUT ME:</h2>
  <p class="desc2">I am from the Philippines, residing in Pasay City. My hobbies mostly involve my Personal Computer, such as playing videogames like Counter Strike, and Valorant. I also have a lengthy experience in soldering, mostly custom mechanical Keyboards. So far this course, although it is my second, has been fun, and align with my interests more. Formerly my goal in life was to become an Electronics Engineer, but due to these new circumstances, it is now to become a successful IT businessman.</p>
